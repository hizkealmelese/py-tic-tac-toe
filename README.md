The EXE file was made with auto-py-to-exe

My first project, basic console-only tic tac toe game
includes: vs. computer mode
          vs. friend mode
          previous game history 
          customizable game board size

The X and O symbols used to emojis but unfortunately that can't be displayed in CMD so that explains the weird symbols
The "A.I." of the game is semi-unbeatable, this is mostly by design, it works by trying to end the game in a tie rather than win (I am too lazy and tired to deal with that lol)
